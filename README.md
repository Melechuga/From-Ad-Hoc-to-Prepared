# From Ad-Hoc to Prepared
## Best-Practices for Organizations whose Staff/Volunteers Experience Online Harassment

**Objective:** To collaborate across the social justice and technology sectors to identify and build best-practices so that organizations can effectively and successfully support their staff + volunteers who experience online harassment. The long-term goal of this is to reduce the impact of harassment experienced by staff, and thus reduce staff turnover, the impact of trauma on the team, and to build the internal capacity for resilience.

By developing this framework with others, we are working with stakeholders who will put these guidelines to use and share them with other like-minded organizations. This group looks to:

* Develop concrete and technical actions to support staff/volunteers at the moment they experience harassment
* Build a framework for anti-harassment infrastructure to prevent and educate staff about online harassment.
* Provide guidelines for senior level staff to articulate and express their stance against online harassment.

**DEFINITION:**

Online harassment can be difficult to clearly define, in part because context is so important. It includes a spectrum of behaviors ranging from explicit to subtle and is often part of, rather than separate from, underlying prejudices and power structure imbalances, such as misogyny, sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, ageism and class and mental health prejudice. Sustained, unwanted contact can be a feature of online harassment, or direct contact can be absent while only orchestration is present. Other abusive behaviors include but are not limited to dogpiling, doxxing, shaming, stalking, swatting, and graphic threats. Online harassment takes many forms and goes by several related descriptors including online abuse, trolling, cyberbullying, cyber violence and electronic aggression.

In the United States, electronic aggression and cyberbullying have been defined by the [Centers for Disease Control (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/ea-tipsheet-a.pdf) and [National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL)](http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/school-bullying-overview.aspx#1) respectively. The CDC defines any type of harassment or bullying that occurs through email, a chat room, instant messaging, a website (including blogs), or text messaging as electronic aggression.  Similarly, the NCSL defines cyberbullying as the willful and repeated use of mobile phones, computers, and other electronic communication devices to harass and threaten others.
